A small program to check if the PC is idle and report it to an MQTT queue for
smart home automation. Based on [go-idle](https://github.com/ka2n/go-idle) and
[HASS.agent](https://github.com/LAB02-Research/HASS.Agent).

Only reads if the screen is on or off. Should be able to improve to detect if the PC is logged in or not.

Lacks configuration.
